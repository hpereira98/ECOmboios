# ECOmboios
Database Project for a train company in MySQL and MongoDB

This project was done entirely in Portuguese (well, except the code part) and the whole process is described on the file Relat√≥rio. 
It goes from the collection of the database requirements to the realization of the SQL physical model and the
implementation of the queries that would be executed on the database. 

The second part of the project was to migrate the data of the SQL database to a new one built in MongoDB, which means we had to
map the data to a NoSQL structure.
